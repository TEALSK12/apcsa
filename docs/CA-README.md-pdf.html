Aligning TEALS APCSA Teaching Resources with the BC Curriculum
--------

This course focuses on object-oriented programming and problem solving in Java. The intended use is for schools offering AP College Board’s Computer Science A course. For schools in BC, Canada, the course can be adapted to align with BC’s grade 12 [Computer Programming](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/12/computer-programming) or [Computer Science](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/12/computer-science) courses. Since 2018, our community partner BCIT has been supporting the curriculum alignment work. Here are highlights of the changes:

* Added Culture Days
* Created alternative, open-ended unit projects: [Unit 1](Unit1/Lesson-107b.md.-pdf.html), [Unit 3](Unit3/Lesson-318a.md.-pdf.html), [Unit 4](Unit4/Lesson-409b.md.-pdf.html) and [Unit 5](Unit5/Lesson-506b.md.-pdf.html)
* Incorprated BC curriculum's core competencies: communication, creative and critical thinking, personal and social responsibilities
* Included components of BC courses learning standards: big ideas, curricular competencies and content

For Computer Programming 12 (Applied Design, Skills and Technologies)
--------
#### Curricular Competencies
* Curricular competencies under Applied Skills, such as ideating, prototyping and testing, are incorporated into the alternative projects and throughout the course.
* Activities involved conducting user-centred research are added to the course.

#### Content
* Students learn advance programming structure, documentation, error handling and debugging, etc.
* Throughout the course, students are encouraged to collaborate. Students are also given opportunities to develop interpersonal skills with Culture Day activities such as [Student Research Project and Presentation](culturedays/culture_day_lesson_b.md.-pdf.html) and [Interviewing an IT Professional](culturedays/culture_day_lesson_d.md.-pdf.html) 
* In the open-ended projects, students apply design thinking skills and programming concepts.  

For Computer Science 12 (Mathematics)
--------
#### Curricular Competencies
* Reasoning and analyzing: Students explore, analyze, and apply mathematical ideas and computer science concepts in various exercises and projects in the course.
* Understanding and solving: Throughout the course, students represent computer science ideas in concrete, pictorial, and symbolic forms, such as writing psudocode or creating diagrams.
* Communicating and representing: Students have opportunities, through various lesson activities, explain and justify computer science ideas. Teaching strategies such as Think-Pair-Share or pair-programming are encourged in the teaching guides 
* Connecting and reflecting: Students have opportunities throughout the course to reflect on mathematical and computational thinking

#### Content
* In Unit 3 [Calculator Project](Unit3/Lesson-318a.md.-pdf.html), students will apply mathematics in situational contexts.
* In Unit 4 [Open-Ended Programming Project](Unit4/Lesson-409b.md.-pdf.html), students have the option to develop their own encryption/decryption program.
