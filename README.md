AP Computer Science A Curriculum
====================================================================================================

This project contains the curriculum source for the TEALS AP Computer Science A curriculum, as it
existed at 2017 March 12. At this point, it contains all of the content of the original zip archive
file from the Sharepoint site (off the TEALS dashboard), minus duplicate PDF versions of files.

These documents will be converted from Word to Markdown, and from there incorporated into a GitHub
book using [GitBook].


Versioning
----------
For purposes of versioning, we will be using _major_._minor_._patch_ notation. For now, we'll keep
the exact definitions of each fuzzy, which is particularly appropriate given that we're mostly
talking about documentation as opposed to software (what's a “breaking change” in documentation?).
Versions will come up with Git tags, change logs, and possibly releases (such as zip archives).
